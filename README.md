Breakout

This project is an implementation of the game Breakout 
for Homework 2 in CS 447.

Features
The ball bounces at a random angle relatively close to 90 degrees 
off any surface. This makes it so the ball does not travel in a 
fixed trajectory everytime. There are three levels, each with a 
different layout of blocks.
